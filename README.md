A companion app to the board game Letters From Whitechapel. Writing in Java for Android application. Will likely need porting eventually to iOS for general applicability.
Purpose is to provide record keeping for constables, marking where clues have been found, where Jack started, which move is current,
and calculating possible ending points based off information gathered.

(i.e. It is the end of night 2, you have gathered 4 clues and numbered them sequentially based off of your estimations of Jack's path. The constable companion will keep record of this, compile it to past and future nights to handle the tedious math of possible ending locations for Jack's hideout.)

Shouldn't hinder game balancing, only act as digital record keeping. Analogous to going from doing long division by hand, to getting a calculator to handle it for you.

Might eventually add Jack helper, to help map routes to ensure safe return.

Only functionality for now, will eventually work on creating slick UI.
