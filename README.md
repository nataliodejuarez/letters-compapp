# letters-compapp
A companion app to the board game Letters From Whitechapel. Writing in Objective-C, Go, or Java. Will likely need porting regardless.
Purpose is to provide record keeping for constables, marking where clues have been found, where Jack started, which move is current,
and calculating possible ending points based off information gathered.

Might eventually add Jack helper, to help map routes to ensure safe return.

Only functionality for now, will eventually work on creating slick UI.
